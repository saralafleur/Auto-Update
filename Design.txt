What if you want to update Node.Host?
	- can we?

Based on the design, the Node.Host never updates, only the Plugins
- I think we need to update the Host

So the concept is here is that a Host can contain multiple plugins
The plugins can then be added and updated at will
Which allows for expansion and rapid response to needs
Ability to facilute a large network of Nodes
All withing the concept of remote ability
